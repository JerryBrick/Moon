Mod loader for Halo: The Master Chief Collection.

This wraps the DInput8 DLL and loads any custom DLLs from mods folder. 
This works in the same way as Chimera's mod loader, aka Monolith 
(https://github.com/SnowyMouse/chimera/tree/master/src/monolith).

## Installation
1. Copy DInput8.dll file to your Halo TMCC folder.
2. Create a folder called "mods"
(e.g. "D:\Halo The Master Chief Collection\mods").
3. Drop your custom DLLs in there.
